# Individual Self-Assessment

## Self-Assessment

We had a baby two weeks prior to the final being due. When I originally signed up for the class, she was due September 9th, the same day our first son was born. I planned on having this class finished prior to the delivery of our third. We were 9 weeks into the course when the baby was diagnosed with IUGR. It was rough from that point on. I fell far behind a few times.

As far as the final goes, I think I did a great job. I chose to work alone because I wanted to develop something for our business. Of course, in the middle of the project the baby arrived unexpectedly. I couldnâ€™t get as much as I wanted to get done, but I'm still happy with how the project went and turned out. 

## Team Assessment

I worked solo but was bummed I didn't get a chance to work together on a project with my other classmates. 

## Summary of Project

I built a competitive analysis using the Etsy API to evaluate where we stand as a business compared to our competition. The API runs at the top and bottom of every hour collecting data from our competition. This will help us discover when Esty is most active and what influence different times have on sales. The data also shows us how many sales each store is getting compared to our sales data. Overall, I had a great time making this project, even though I ran into several issues along the way. I was able to work through those problems from material I learned in this class. Thank you!
